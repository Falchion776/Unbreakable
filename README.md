### Unbreakable
A Fire Emblem Sacred Stones ROM Hack

## About the Project
Unbreakable is a ROM Hack of the Game Boy Advanced game Fire Emblem the Sacred Stones. The goal of the project was to create unbreakable legendary weapons for a more casual playthrough and an easier post-game experience. The hack also adds in additional conversations for each of the legendary weapons when obtained with a certain character.

## Built With
This ROM hack was made using [FEBuilderGBA](https://github.com/FEBuilderGBA/FEBuilderGBA) and tested using [mGBA](https://mgba.io/) emulator. 

## Getting Started
In order to apply this patch you'll need the Unbreakable.ups file, the NUPS patching program, and a clean Sacred Stones ROM. I cannot provide the ROM, you must obtain this on your own. The NUPS patching program can be found [here](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/606/). 
Once you have all the pieces do the following:
1. Open NUPS
2. Select your clean Sacred Stones ROM as the "File to Patch"
3. Select Unbrealable.ups as the "UPS patch"
4. Hit Patch and you'll be able to play the Unbreakable ROM hack on the GBA emulator of your choice
